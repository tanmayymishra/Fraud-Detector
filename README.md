This model predicts whether the customer is legit or a fraudulent agent by using developed machine learning methods , the model takes several values as input and based on those values generate a binary classification value (i.e 0,1) in which if the value is 0 then we can say that the particular person is not fraud if the value is 1 then the user is fraud.
